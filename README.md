# Heart-Disease-Dashboard
Overview
The Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard provides a comprehensive visualization of key health metrics related to heart disease patients. It is designed to help medical professionals, researchers, and data analysts monitor survival trends, understand the impact of risk factors, and identify critical patterns across different age groups.

This dashboard enables quick and effective decision-making by presenting survival rates, serum creatinine levels, ejection fractions, and the impact of comorbidities such as smoking, high blood pressure, anemia, and diabetes.

Key Features
Survival Rate Overview

Displays the overall survival rate (67.89%).

Provides total survival count (203) and death count (96).

Age-Based Analysis

Survival Count & Serum Creatinine: Tracks survival count and average serum creatinine levels across age groups.

Survival Count & Ejection Fraction: Shows survival count with average ejection fraction levels.

Survival Rate by Age Group: Visualizes survival rates across age categories for better risk assessment.

Impact of Comorbidities

Analyzes the effect of smoking, high blood pressure, anemia, and diabetes across different age groups using a Sankey flow visualization.

Gender Insights

Provides data segmentation by male and female patients.

Data Insights
Highest survival rate observed in the 61–70 age group (75.90%).

Noticeable drop in survival rates in patients above 71 years (40.38%) and below 40 years (0%).

Serum creatinine levels are higher in the 51–60 and 71+ age groups.

Ejection fraction varies significantly, with a peak in the 71+ age group (42.10).

Comorbidities (smoking, high BP, anemia, diabetes) show varying influence across different age groups.

Target Audience
Healthcare Professionals: For patient risk assessment and care planning.

Researchers: To analyze survival trends and comorbidity impacts.

Public Health Analysts: For data-driven policy and awareness campaigns.

Technologies Used
Data Visualization Tool: (Specify if Power BI, Tableau, or custom dashboard framework was used)

Data Sources: Heart disease patient datasets (can specify hospital/clinical study if applicable).
